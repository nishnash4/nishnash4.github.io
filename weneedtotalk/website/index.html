                        <p>At our November 1st meeting, we learned that our group extends well beyond our discord channels. As such, we’ve decided to copy announcements from the discord to this website.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Nov. 2, 12:32 PM - Statement on Communication</h3>
                        <blockquote>@everyone Please keep the group and <b>[Redacted - See note below]</b> as quiet as you can, don’t put it out publicly to social media and try to keep it between friends. We realize there’s been some miscommunication on this front, and we apologize! This is the consensus for now, after the Monday meeting please spread the word far and wide for <b>[Redacted - See note below]</b> and collectively decided platform! As always, thank you for continuing to support this platform. Tigers, it’s almost time to ROAR.</blockquote>
                        <h5>Note:</h5>
                        <h5>We released some info early, that was later voted to be kept on the down low until the 5th. You’ll notice the announcement below deals with a similar issue.</h5>
                        <h5>I’ll be amending these two announcements on the 5th the second the group votes to release the info.</h5>
                        
                        <h3>Nov. 2, 12:07 AM</h3>
                        <blockquote>Hey @everyone - thank you so much for coming out tonight, contributing on Discord, and being a part of something amazing. Just as amazing is the status of the active petitions - nearly 3,000 people on PawPrints and we’re about to hit 5,000 on Change.org! This is a massive undertaking, and I am continually stunned by the collaboration, determination, and conviction of the people here.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>A couple quick updates - we will be having another meeting on Monday, November 5th at 8pm to refine the message that we want to send as well as the actionable items that we want implemented by the administration. The current plan is <b>[Redacted - see note below]</b> We have a lot of announcements to make over the next couple days and there is a lot of work to do to prepare, so keep your eyes on the #announcements-readme channel to stay informed. Thank you all again so much for being a part of this, we are firsthand witnessing the power of people to create change, and I hope you are as proud as I am to be advocating for mental health on campus with everyone here. :heart:</blockquote>
