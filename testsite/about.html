                        “I’ve enjoyed some exciting adventures, white-water rafting through the Grand Canyon, fly fishing  the great rivers of the West, hiking in Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and Arizona and kayaking across the Gulf of Alaska,” Holdren says, “yet the Adirondacks retains its mystical hold on me. Paddling a remote lake, or climbing in the High Peaks, there’s a magical connection between the beauty of wild, unspoiled places and a power greater than our own.”
